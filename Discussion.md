## **Solutions Considered**  

### **1. Loading Entire File into Memory (Inefficient)**
- **Approach:** Read the entire 1TB log file into memory and filter the relevant logs.  
- **Why It Was Rejected:**  
  - Not feasible for a 1TB file due to high RAM usage.  
  - Extremely slow and may cause memory crashes.  

### **2. Using Regular Expressions for Searching**
- **Approach:** Use regex patterns to search for logs matching the date.  
- **Why It Was Rejected:**  
  - While regex is powerful, it adds unnecessary computational overhead.  
  - Line-by-line filtering is faster and more memory-efficient.  

### **3. Efficient Line-by-Line Processing (Final Solution)**
- **Approach:** Read the file **line by line**, check if a line starts with the given date, and write matching lines to an output file.  
- **Why It Was Chosen:**  
  - Uses minimal memory (does not load the entire file).  
  - Works efficiently on large files.  
  - Simple and easy to implement.  

---

## **Final Solution Summary**  
The final solution reads the log file **line by line** and extracts logs for the specified date. It writes the matched logs into an output file while keeping memory usage low.  

### **Key Benefits:**  
âœ… **Handles Large Files**: Works efficiently on 1TB+ files.  
âœ… **Optimized Performance**: Avoids unnecessary computations like regex parsing.  
âœ… **Minimal Memory Usage**: Only processes relevant data.  

---

## **Steps to Run the Solution**  

### **1. Download the Log File**  
Run this command in **Command Prompt (cmd) or VS Code Terminal** to download the log file:  

```cmd
curl -L -o log_2024.log "https://limewire.com/d/90794bb3-6831-4e02-8a59-ffc7f3b8b2a3#X1xnzrH5s4H_DKEkT_dfBuUT1mFKZuj4cFWNoMJGX98"
```

### **2. Create the Python Script**  
1. Open **VS Code**.  
2. Click **File â†’ New File**, name it **`extract_logs.py`**.  
3. Copy and paste this code:  

```python
import sys
import os

def extract_logs(log_file, date):
    output_dir = "output"
    os.makedirs(output_dir, exist_ok=True)
    output_file = os.path.join(output_dir, f"output_{date}.txt")

    try:
        with open(log_file, "r", encoding="utf-8") as infile, open(output_file, "w", encoding="utf-8") as outfile:
            for line in infile:
                if line.startswith(date):
                    outfile.write(line)
        print(f'Logs for {date} saved to {output_file}')
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error processing file: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    if len(sys.argv) != 3:
        print("Usage: python extract_logs.py <log_file> <YYYY-MM-DD>")
        sys.exit(1)

    log_file = sys.argv[1]
    date = sys.argv[2]
    extract_logs(log_file, date)
```

4. Save the file.  

---

### **3. Run the Script**  
Open **VS Code terminal** and navigate to the folder containing `extract_logs.py` and `log_2024.log` using:  

```cmd
cd C:\path\to\your\folder
```

Then, run the script:  

```cmd
python extract_logs.py log_2024.log 2024-12-01
```

(Replace `2024-12-01` with any date you want.)

---

### **4. Verify the Output**  
The extracted logs will be stored in the **output** folder. To check:  

```cmd
type output\output_2024-12-01.txt
```

Or open it in VS Code.

---

### **Troubleshooting**  
If you get an error:  
- **File not found?** â†’ Run `dir` to check if `log_2024.log` exists.  
- **Wrong directory?** â†’ Use `cd` to navigate to the correct folder.  
- **Python not found?** â†’ Install it from [Python Official Website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
